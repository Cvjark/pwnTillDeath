# about
Return-oriented programming (ROP) is a mechanism that can be leveraged to bypass exploit mitigation schemes such as NX/DEP. 
[ROP-Emporium ](https://ropemporium.com/) provides a series of challenges that are designed to teach ROP in isolation, with minimal requirement for reverse-engineering or bug hunting. Each challenge introduces a new concept with slowly increasing complexity. 
Follow the links on the homepage to see exercise descriptions and the challenge binaries. Sometimes a few clues as to how you might go about solving a challenge are included, but there aren't any spoilers.
